# Abuse / Anomaly Detection in Text Messages

## Description
This project detects abusive or anomalous text messages using pure Python. 
It is fully self-contained and does not require any external libraries.

## Methodology

 Step 1: Input Parsing – Messages are read from a list (or file)

 Step 2: Keyword Matching – Checks for abusive words

 Step 3: Anomaly Detection – Flags suspicious messages

 Step 4: Output Classification – Labels messages as Safe or Abusive

## How to Run
1. Open [abuse_detection.py](./abuse_detection.py) in Python 3.x
2. Run the script
3. Check the console output for flagged messages

## Example Output

Safe: You are amazing!

Abusive: I hate you!

Abusive: You are stupid

Safe: Have a great day!

Abusive: This is terrible

Summary: 3/5 messages flagged as abusive (60.0%)
